    <!-- Page one: describe who you are, where you come from - hobbies, hometown,     family, friends, etc.
          Page two: describe where you are going in life and who you'll become, talk about career goals, education goals, hopes, dreams, etc.
          Link the two pages together with anchors. For ex: <a href="page2.html"</a>, as long as page2.html lives in the same folder as index.html.
          And, somewhere on the site include a gif about how I feel about the new career.-->

                    <p class="p1">I originally hail from the Mitten, in a suburb called White Lake. Hold up your right hand, palm facing you. Find the center of the meaty part of your thumb - that’s roughly the Detroit area; I grew up an hour to the north. After college, my (now) husband and I left the mid-west in search of adventure. We landed in Seattle, just off Capitol Hill, and fell in love with the P-Northwest. A circuitous route with many stops along the way has brought us back to the Evergreen State and now, with our son, we happily call WA our home. </p>
                    <p class="p2">As a family, we enjoy hiking and exploring new places (and old ones, too). We also like to eat food and drink drinks. In those rare moments when I’m on my own I enjoy running, shopping, reading a good book, and dreaming about the day I can once again grab my paddle board, walk across the street, and go for a ride.</p>
