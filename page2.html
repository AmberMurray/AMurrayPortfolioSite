                        <p class="p1">Learn.  Work.  Play.  Repeat. This is the roadmap for my self-reinvention project. Amber 2.0 began a few years ago when I discovered that I really liked playing around with websites and code. I worked through online tutorials and talked with coder-friends, but self-reinvention without real focus is just silly. I look forward to the journey with Galvanize to target my education and provide me with ninja-like programming skills, thus completing my transformation!</p>
                        <p class="p2">Post graduation (or in that ballpark), I hope to gain employment in an environment where I can continue to refine my newly acquired skills, while also adding others. I believe front-end development is where I will best fit, but am open to any experience that will stretch my brain and transform my creations from pipe-dreams into pixels.</p>
                        <p class="p3">...And if all the pieces fall into place, WA will still be home and I will get to keep exploring, eating, drinking, and dreaming with my family. </p>
